# Music Recommender App

## Motivation

Spotify’s recommendation system has become less effective and TikTok dominates music discovery. We aim to build a robust alternative that suggests new songs based on a user’s existing playlists and preferences.

## Core Features

- **Recommendation System:**  
  Suggest songs given specific artists, genres, or tracks the user already listens to.  
- **UI & Search:**  
  Clean, intuitive interface; song/artist statistics; search functionality.

## Optional Features

- **Spotify API Integration:**  
  Connect to a user’s Spotify playlist and generate recommendations based on it.

## Pages

- **Home:**  
  Navbar linking all functions; brief description of the app.  
- **Top Songs:**  
  Displays global all‑time top tracks and top tracks from the last month.  
- **Song:**  
  User selects a track; view personalized recommendations.  
- **Artist:**  
  User selects an artist; view similar artists and recommended songs.  
- **Genre:**  
  View song recommendations by preferred genre.  
- **Search:**  
  Search for songs by name, artist, genre, etc.
